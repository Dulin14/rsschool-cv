## Abdout Me

I am constantly looking for general knowledge and skills that will enhance my personality.
I am interested in new technologies and can apply them quickly. I like teamwork because
the opportunities and conditions for learning within the majority will be good. I donâ€™t like
lies and irresponsibility.
I always put my career first. And I directly link my career with the development of the
place where I work.
